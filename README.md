# Autonomous-Question-Tagging
This project focuses on developing an autonomous
tagging system for Stack Overflow, a popular platform for
computer science and programming questions. Currently, users
manually enter tags for their questions, which can be inaccurate
or insufficient. To address this issue, we applied machine learning
methods along with essential data preprocessing
techniques.
