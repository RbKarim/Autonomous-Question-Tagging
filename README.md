# ***Autonomous Question Tagging***

This project focused on developing an autonomous
tagging system for *Stack Overflow*, a popular platform for
computer science and programming related questions. Currently, users
manually entered tags for their questions, which could be inaccurate
or insufficient. To address this issue, we applied machine learning
methods along with essential data preprocessing
techniques.
